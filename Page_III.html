     We come together to celebrate when a child is born, when children get married and when someone passes on.<br /> Gatherings are more festive when children are born and at marriages.<br /> Death celebrations happen after the deceased has been buried.<br /> There is food and drinks for all and a display of traditional dances to useher the spirit of the deceased to the Ancestors.<br />
