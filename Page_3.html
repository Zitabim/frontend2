    <p> 
     Anywhere from 2 â€“ 7 days, depending on your body type, activity levels, and what you're eating.<br /> 
     The fastest way to get into ketosis is to exercise on an empty stomach,<br /> 
     restrict your carbohydrate intake to 20g or less per day, and be vigilant with your water intake.<br />
