     Our Region is found in the Savanna climatic zone where tubers thrive.<br /> Our Staple food is called "Achu". It is made from cocoyams. <br />After boiling, the Cocoyam is pounded to a smooth consistency in a mortar and tied in plantain leaves.<br /> The soup is made from palm oil and limestone with alot of meat and cow skin.<br /> During special ceremonies like traditional marriages, the achu is eaten with a special soup made from pumpkin seeds.<br /> It is not uncommon to have a glass of freshly tapped palmwine to accompany your achu.<br /> Enjoy <img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1lai7ZOvrTw/Vmr5yMaYEfI/AAAAAAAABu8/eNwqfHNM9vM/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/ACHU%2BDONE.JPG" height="15%" width="15%" />
